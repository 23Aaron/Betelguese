### Overview
**To install**, simply run `brew install betelguese` if you use [brew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) or download the [latest release](https://github.com/23Aaron/Betelguese/releases), and just open!<br/>
**Before running the GUI, make sure you jailbreak with checkra1n beforehand.**<br/>
**After you run the GUI, make sure to install Rocketbootstrap and Preferenceloader before anything else.**<br/>
libhooker installation and activation is automatically handled.<br/>
Compatibility is with every device that checkra1n is compatible with as this is a bootstrap installed over checkra1n's.<br/>

Because of Procursus, you are now able to install **all four main package managers natively (for the first time)**.<br/>
Sileo (**Preinstalled**), Cydia (available on Procursus), Zebra (available on Procursus), and Installer.<br/>

It's further to note that Procursus is also maintained **by the community** with its build system by [@Diatrus](https://twitter.com/Diatrus) & [@hbkirb](https://twitter.com/hbkirb).<br/>
Documentation for further contribution is available here: [Procursus/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
