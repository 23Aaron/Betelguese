This repository acts as a GUI for the Odysseyra1n bootstrap installation. Made mostly with Swift.<br/>
**To install**, simply run `brew install betelguese` if you use brew or download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/23Aaron/Betelguese/releases), and just open. Simple as that!<br/>

**Before running the GUI, make sure you jailbreak with checkra1n beforehand.**<br/>
**After you run the GUI, make sure to install Rocketboostrap and Preferenceloader before anything else.**<br/>
libhooker installation and activation is automatically handled.<br/>
Compatibility is with every device that checkra1n is compatible with as this is a bootstrap installed over checkra1n's.<br/>

Because of Procursus, you are now able to have support for **all four main package managers natively (for the first time)**.<br/>
Sileo (**Preinstalled**), Cydia (*on the Procursus Repo, forked by Kronos*), Zebra, and Installer.<br/>

It's further to note that Procursus is also maintained **by the community** with its build system by [@Diatrus](https://twitter.com/Diatrus) & [@hbkirb](https://twitter.com/hbkirb).<br/>
Documentation for further contribution is available here: [Procursus](https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus)
