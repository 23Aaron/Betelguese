This repository acts as a GUI for the Odysseyra1n bootstrap installation. Made mostly with Swift.</br>
**To install**, download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/23Aaron/Betelguese/releases), and just open. Simple as that!</br>

**Before running the GUI, make sure you jailbreak with checkra1n beforehand.**</br>
**After you run the GUI, make sure to install Rocketboostrap and Preferenceloader before anything else.**</br>
libhooker installation and activation is automatically handled.</br>
Compatibility is with every device that checkra1n is compatible with as this is a bootstrap installed over checkra1n's.</br>

Because of Procursus, you are now able to have support for **all four main package managers natively (for the first time)**.</br>
Sileo (**Preinstalled**), Cydia (*on the Procursus Repo, forked by Kronos*), Zebra, and Installer.</br>

It's further to note that Procursus is also maintained **by the community** with it's build system by [@Diatrus](https://twitter.com/Diatrus) & [@hbkirb](https://twitter.com/hbkirb)<br/>
Documentation for further contribution is available here: [Procursus](https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus)
